## Overview
Analysis is needed to determine the viability of a bike sharing business in Des Moines, IA. In order to determine potential factors to consider in starting a bikesharing company CitiBike data was used from bike sharing in New York City. For this project Tableau and Python were used to manipulate and visualize the results of the analysis. 

## Results
Analysis was completed by looking at the month of August bike sharing data from CitiBike. During this period of time there were 2,344,224 rides completed with the highest number of rides lasting a duration of five minutes.

Ridership is the highest among males in the morning and evening hours most likely because of work commutes.

To determine if the business woudl be viable in Des Moines further analysis of the Des Moines populatioon would be needed.
